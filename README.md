> Eclipse SmartHome UI

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## ToDos

 - Finnish gulp to build modules 
 - Add ESH start page tile
 - Add CSS preprocessor sample to quickly enable less/stylus
 - Add concat/minify step
 

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-eclipse-smarthome-ui 
using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-eclipse-smarthome-ui
```

Then change into the ui folder of your [Eclipse SmartHome](https://eclipse.org/smarthome) clone 
or use [Eclipse Installer](http://www.eclipse.org/smarthome/documentation/development/ide.html) to setup everything for you.
That will clone ESH for you, too. 

Then change to the ESH folder and generate your new user interface:

```bash
#git clone https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome.git ./esh
cd esh/extensions/ui
yo eclipse-smarthome-ui
```

After that, open the Eclipse Import dialog and re-scan the ESH folder. Deselect all and select onyl your new UI.
Maybe indexing takes a while. Then edit the launch config (little arrow next to the play/debug button on the toolbar)
and add your UI to the launch config. Then start Eclipse and here you go.
